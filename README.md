# My personal website

This website is built based on a **Jekyll** fork from [Leonid Keselman](https://github.com/leonidk/new_website) using [Jon Barron's website template](https://github.com/jonbarron/website). The deployment script [bin/deploy](bin/deploy) is borrowed from [Maruan Al-Shedivat's al-folio template](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).

## Usage

- To deploy from source to master: ./bin/deploy --user
- Remember to push from source to remote: git push origin source
